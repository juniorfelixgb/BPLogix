In the software development, using C# as a programming language I use 2 collections types:

1. List<T>: is a generic collection that permit storage element of any type an ordered list. The elements can access by index and can be add, delete and modify of efficient way.

2. Dictionary<K, V>: is a generic collection that storage key value pairs, where each key is unique inside of dictionary. Provide a quick
search of a specific value using a specific key.

The principal differences between both collections is focused on your structure and your use.
